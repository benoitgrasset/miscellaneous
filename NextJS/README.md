## Server component

- Server-side data fetching

- Smaller bundle size

- This can enhance performance by decreasing data fetching time and reducing the number of client requests, faster initial page load 

- It also means you donâ€™t have to expose API keys in the browser or worry about CORS
 
- They can also be pre-rendered or cached on the server


## Drawbacks

- More complex
- Higher demand for server resources - Increased Server Load - Increased cost - Scalability and performance
